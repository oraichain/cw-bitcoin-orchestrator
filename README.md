## üõ† Developing

### Prerequisites

You should install the following dependencies beforehand:

- NPM
- Yarn (Yarn Berry 4.x is recommended)

Checkout the repository and bootstrap the yarn workspace:

```sh
# Clone the repo.
git clone https://github.com/oraichain/cw-bitcoin-orchestrator
cd cw-bitcoin-orchestrator
yarn
```

### Updating the packages

If you want to change the build and sdk packages, you can follow our [contract management pattern](https://docs.orai.io/developer-guides/cosmwasm-contract/manage-contract-pattern). Below are the commands we use to build the contract and generate types:

```sh
# build code:
cwtools build ../cw-bitcoin/contracts/* -o packages/contracts-build/data
# build schema
cwtools build ../cw-bitcoin/contracts/* -s
# gen code:
cwtools gents ../cw-bitcoin/contracts/* -o packages/contracts-sdk/src
# gen doc:
yarn docs
```

### Testing

```sh
# Run all tests
yarn test

# ES lint
yarn eslint
```

### Building

```sh
yarn build
```

### Publishing

```sh
yarn deploy
```

### Patch a package

```sh
yarn patch-package @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate
```

For publishing onto NPM, you will need an credential key. Hence, it's best to let the github workflow do the work.
